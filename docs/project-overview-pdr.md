# GoClaw Deploy — Project Overview & PDR

## Project Vision

Provide a production-ready, containerized packaging of GoClaw that enables fast deployment across local development, cloud platforms, and PaaS systems. Simplify multi-LLM agent orchestration with a single Docker image bundling backend, frontend, database, and reverse proxy.

## Project Goals

1. **Single-Image Deployment** — Complete GoClaw stack in one Docker image with zero external dependencies except PostgreSQL.
2. **Multi-Environment Support** — Same image works locally, on servers, and managed platforms (Dokploy, etc.).
3. **Zero-Downtime Releases** — Automated sync + build + push + smoke test pipeline with no manual intervention.
4. **Developer Friendly** — Clear compose variants for dev/prod/PaaS, simple env var config, comprehensive docs.
5. **Security by Default** — Non-root containers, capability dropping, tmpfs protections, security headers.

## Target Users

- **Platform Teams** — Deploy GoClaw across infrastructure with minimal ops overhead
- **Developers** — Rapid local testing and iteration using docker-compose
- **DevOps Engineers** — Integrate via automated release.sh pipeline
- **PaaS Users** — One-click deployments on Dokploy, Railway, Render, etc.

## Key Features

### Deployment Flexibility
- **Production** (docker-compose.yml) — Pre-built image from Docker Hub, instant startup
- **Development** (docker-compose-build.yml) — Build from source, test changes locally
- **PaaS** (docker-compose-dokploy.yml) — External network support for managed platforms

### Automated Release Workflow
- Sync upstream (`goclaw-core`) with conflict detection
- Auto-review config changes (Dockerfile, nginx.conf)
- Multi-arch build (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Smoke test post-push before marking release complete

### Integrated Backend + Frontend
- Go backend (port 18790 internally, proxied by nginx)
- React SPA served from nginx (port 8080)
- WebSocket support for real-time agent updates
- API routing at /v1/

### Database Integration
- PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector extension (vector embeddings)
- Auto-migration on startup (managed mode)
- Persistent named volumes for data
- Healthcheck integration

### Security Hardening
- Non-root user with capability restrictions
- tmpfs protections, resource limits
- Security headers (XSS, clickjacking, referrer policies)
- Configuration via git-ignored .env file

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Multi-Stage Docker Build
**Rationale:** Separate compilation toolchains from runtime, minimize image size.
**Impact:** ~500MB final image instead of ~2GB with dependencies.

### Decision: Named Build Context for Deploy Configs
**Rationale:** Avoid including deploy repo in Docker build context; keep separation of concerns.
**Impact:** Dockerfile can reference `../goclaw-core` as build context while importing configs from deploy repo.

### Decision: Three Compose Variants
**Rationale:** Support different deployment scenarios without duplicating service definitions.
**Impact:** Single Dockerfile, three compositions for dev/prod/PaaS flexibility.

### Decision: Auto-Migration on Startup
**Rationale:** Zero-downtime deployments; schema migrations run transparently.
**Impact:** Container startup slightly longer, but enables safe image updates.

### Decision: Fully Automated Release Pipeline
**Rationale:** Reduce human error, enable frequent releases, ensure consistency.
**Impact:** release.sh as single source of truth; smoke tests catch breakage before push.

## Technical Constraints

### Upstream Dependency
- **goclaw-core** repo (sibling directory ../goclaw-core)
- Requires main + develop branches
- Must have upstream remote configured
- Uses git tags for versioning

### Docker Requirements
- Docker buildx (multi-arch support)
- Compose v2+ (health checks, additional_contexts)
- ~2GB free disk per build

### Platform Support
- **Linux:** Full support (amd64, arm64)
- **macOS:** Works locally, but M1/M2 (arm64) built images run slower on amd64 targets
- **Windows:** Requires WSL 2 with Docker Desktop

### Build-Time Requirements
- Go 1.25+ (for cross-compilation flags)
- Node 22+ (for pnpm, Vite build)
- Alpine 3.22+ (runtime stability)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

**Risk: Upstream Merge Conflicts**
- Impact: Release blocked until manually resolved
- Mitigation: release.sh detects conflicts, provides clear resolution steps

**Risk: Multi-Arch Build Failures**
- Impact: One platform (amd64 or arm64) fails to build
- Mitigation: Local test build on primary arch before publishing

### Medium Risks

**Risk: Database Migration Failure**
- Impact: Container startup fails, service unavailable
- Mitigation: Healthcheck catches issues; smoke tests verify; rollback via image tag

**Risk: Docker Hub Credentials Leak**
- Impact: Unauthorized image pushes
- Mitigation: Use PAT (Personal Access Token) with minimal scope; store in secure secret manager

### Low Risks

**Risk: Compose File Syntax Drift**
- Impact: Deployment fails with parsing error
- Mitigation: release.sh smoke test catches before commit

**Risk: nginx Config Reload Failure**
- Impact: Reverse proxy unavailable
- Mitigation: Container healthcheck from start-period ensures full readiness
